# Eddii's Little Additions

A small addon meant to contain the small things I wanted to add to the game~.

**DISCLAIMER :** Currently in very early stage of development, crashes, errors and bugs are to be expected. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**Will not work properly if not also using LSCG : https://github.com/littlesera/LSCG**

That being said, there is currently only 1 feature : An auto-hug feature !
Jump on your desired targets and grab them for a big hug when they enter the room !

List of commands :
- /hugadd (Member Number): Add the specified member to be hugged on sight.
- /hugremove (Member Number): Remove the specified member from the auto-hug list.
- /hugduration (Duration): Set the approximate time between grab and release (in milliseconds). Cannot be shorter than a second. Setting negative numbers disables auto-release.
- /hugstatus: Provides the current auto-hug list and duration.
